The solution approach for waterlogging prediction focuses on utilising machine learning to predict and mitigate waterlogging events in urban areas by analysing historical data alongside future forecast weather data.

Waterlogging is a pervasive issue in urban areas, arising from a combination of heavy rainfall, inadequate drainage systems, and rapid urbanization. It is a problem with widespread consequences, disrupting transportation networks, damaging infrastructure, posing public health risks, and causing substantial economic losses. With climate change intensifying rainfall patterns and increasing urban densities putting further strain on existing infrastructure, the problem has taken on new urgency. Despite its far-reaching impacts, waterlogging remains under addressed, often tackled reactively rather than proactively, highlighting the need for innovative solutions.

The solution approach for waterlogging prediction focuses on utilising machine learning to predict and mitigate waterlogging events in urban areas by analysing historical data alongside future forecast weather data. The first step of the approach involves collecting diverse data from several sources, including historical rainfall data, drainage system information, land use patterns, and groundwater levels. Each of these data sets plays a crucial role in understanding the factors that contribute to waterlogging. Historical rainfall data offers insight into past precipitation patterns, which is essential for predicting future events. Data on drainage systems helps assess how efficiently water is managed in urban areas, while topographical and elevation data provides information on the land's natural water flow. Urbanisation data allows for the understanding of how developed land can contribute to water retention, and the water table data reflects groundwater levels, influencing how much water the soil can absorb.
Once the data is gathered and cleaned, it is fed into a machine learning model. This model is trained to identify patterns between various factors—such as rainfall intensity, drainage capacity, soil permeability, and elevation—that contribute to waterlogging. Using algorithms like Random Forests or Extreme Gradient Boosting Machines, the model learns the relationships between these features and the occurrence of waterlogging. After training, the model is validated against historical waterlogging data to ensure its predictions are accurate and reliable.
The predictive power of the model is enhanced by integrating real-time weather data through a weather API. This integration allows the model to consider forecasted rainfall, adjusting its predictions dynamically based on incoming weather information. With this setup, the model can not only predict the likelihood of waterlogging for the near future but also issue timely warnings. For instance, if the model predicts heavy rainfall combined with a stressed drainage system in a specific area, it can forecast waterlogging risks and send alerts to users.
In summary, this solution combines machine learning with real-time data integration to predict waterlogging events dynamically. It offers a proactive approach, providing alerts and long-term strategic insights to both individuals and urban planners, ultimately improving urban resilience and minimising the disruptive impacts of waterlogging.
